# Django-Project-CRM
This Django project is a comprehensive web application that handles user authentication and record management. It includes functionalities such as user registration, login, logout, and dashboard access. 
Users can create, view, update, and delete records securely, with each operation protected by the @login_required decorator to ensure only authenticated users can access certain pages. 
The project uses custom forms (CreateUserForm, LoginUser, CreateRecordForm, UpdateRecordForm) to manage user and record data, providing a smooth and secure experience. 
Messages are displayed to inform users of actions, such as successful registration, login, or record updates.
